# JavaScript Assignment Project – UCD

## Purpose
**Tour Bali Like a Local** is a web project designed to help travelers plan a memorable trip to Bali. The goal was to create a site that is practical, welcoming, and genuinely helpful for both first-timers and repeat visitors. All content and code were created for a university web design assignment, with special care given to mobile usability, accessibility, and clean HTML5 structure.
